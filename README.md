# Space Tourism Website - Frontend Mentor

This project was created to practice my frontend skills using React and SCSS. It is one of the challenges off of [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
The goal of this project is to take the base files, and figma layout and create the website as close to the layout as possible. The challenge can be found [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3).
